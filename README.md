# Simple
A Simple showcase for the Sea-of-Nodes compiler IR

This repo is intended to demonstrate the Sea-of-Nodes compiler IR.  
The Sea-of-Nodes is the core IR inside of HotSpot's C2 compiler and Google's V8 compiler and Sun/Oracle's Graal compiler.
Since we are show casing the SoN IR, the *language* being implemented is less important.  
We're using a very simple language similar to C or Java, but with far fewer features.
The Sea-of-Nodes is used for machine code generation in these industrial strength systems - but for this demonstration the backend is both difficult and less important.
This repo also is not intended to be a complete language in any sense, and so the backend will probably start with levering C or Java.
